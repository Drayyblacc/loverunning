# LOVE RUNNING BY DERECK YASU

Welcome to Love Running by Dereck - a portfolio website for html. I have built websites before but with wordpress and this is my first website fully on code HTML and CSS.

Love Running website was built in html and css and it is responsive on all devices. As a visitor you can view a gallery of previously sucessful runs from our athletes in the city, beach and mud runs, with a call-to-action to get in touch with the use of a form.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the website come from that were added by the Project Tutor of Code Institute. The idea was to keep the website looking colourfull and beautiful, whilst still easy to read.

![Blush Bakes by Rach colour palette](assets/images/readme-images/Colors%20for%20Love%20running.png)

### Typography

The fonts used on the website was chosen to make sure text is clear in all devices sizes

Google Fonts was used to import both fonts:

- Lato is the font used on all of the text on the website. This include both a bolder and a lighter font weight.

![Google Fonts used on Love Running by Dereck](assets/images/readme-images/font.png)

Font Awesome is also used for bullet points and the home index page and sign up page on the website.

### Imagery

The imagery on this website is all photography, with the odd Font Awesome icon appearing on home page and sign up page. The photos were from Code Institute and some were from me, only the ones on README.

## Features

The Love Running website contains 3 pages - home page, gallery, sign up and congratulation page. All three pages can be accessed via the navigation menu on the right header of all pages and on the click of the hamburger icon on smaller devices or phones. After the client puts their information on the form and click on the Lets Run Button it opens a congradulations page with the data sent from customer being first name, last name, email, email address and running preference.

### General features on each page

- 3 pages pages show the Love Running text on the left of the page and a responsive navigational bar on the right, in a header at the top of the page.
- In a footer at the bottom of the page are the social media links for Facebook, Twitter, Youtube & Instagram. These are shown as icons.
- A favicon of the logo appears in the browser tab.
****- In the bottom right corner, as you start to scroll down, an arrow appears which enables the user to get back to the top of the page.

#### Home Page

The home page features a bright hero image of three people running underneath the navigational header. There is some welcome text on the far right for bigger screens and in the middle for phone and smaller devices, which introduces the Love Running Club and where they're located.

The next section is broken down into images and text, to give information about why people love running with Love Running club and a lady running, and gives the website users ideas as to what tto expect.

Just above the footer there is a section showing day, time and place of the run.

#### Gallery

In this pages they are a few photos added there for the website viewer to see previous club runs and athletes.

#### Contact

On this page they is a background image and color to make the form shine out bright and easy to read and fill. With the contact form thats when they will fill in their information to enquire and all fields are required before the user clicks on submit and users do get alerted when they haven't filled in these required fields.

#### Congratulations

A simple page with different styling as the website. The form elements have been removed and replaced with a 'Congratulations' message.

### Accessibility

I have tried my best to ensure the site has been made as accessible as possible by:

- Using simple HTML.
- Using alt attributes on images.
- Adding aria-labels for screen labels.
- Using colour contrasts between the text and background.

## Testing

I have seen that its hard to keep in mind all text errors so i will need to start my testing file earlier or just at the beginning of the project so i will building and adding to the testing file up until the end of the project however i fixed a lot of minor issues through out the code and sometimes my code would not work and had to take it offline to test it and discoved that some times CODEANYWHERE would not push my code to Github and had to be trying again and again but unfortunately i have forgotten the list of the errors. 
I therefore created a Testing file, so that you can find some few tests and fixes I did manage to remember.
